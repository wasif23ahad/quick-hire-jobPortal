## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these detailed instructions to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ (Recommended: v20+)
- **npm** or **yarn** or **pnpm**
- **PostgreSQL** database (Local instance or a free [Neon](https://neon.tech) cloud account)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The backend serves the REST API and connects to the PostgreSQL database.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Environment Variables (`backend/.env`)**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Your PostgreSQL connection string. Ensure it includes the database name.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require"

# Secret key used for signing JWT tokens. Use a strong, random string.
JWT_SECRET="your-super-strong-secret-key-here"

# Port for the Express server to run on (Optional, defaults to 5000)
PORT=5000
```

**Database Migration & Seeding**

Deploy the schema using Prisma and seed the database with initial job data:

```bash
# Apply schema to the database
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed the database with 1000 sample jobs
npx prisma db seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The backend API will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a Next.js application that communicates with the backend API.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

**Environment Variables (`frontend/.env.local`)**

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory connecting it to the backend:

```env
# The base URL for the backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

**Start the Next.js Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the application!

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

The application utilizes a relational database mapped via Prisma with the following core entities:

```
User (id, name, email, password, role, created_at)
  │
  └── Application[] (1:N Relationship)

Job (id, title, company, location, category, type, description, salary, company_logo, tags, created_at, updated_at)
  │
  └── Application[] (1:N Relationship)

Application (id, job_id, user_id, name, email, resume_link, cover_note, created_at)
```
